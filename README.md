Facebook GeoInsights Web Scraper

Platform independent.

Requires an installation of Google Chrome and Chrome driver.
Chrome driver needs to be added to Environment Variables.

Enter your mail and password for GeoInsights in 'credentials.py'.
Optionally add the absolute path to your favorite download directory.
Otherwise scraper will store the data in a directory at the location of 'main.py'.

Runs a bit slow, maybe I will improve the performance in the future (probably not).
